# Superstore Sales Analysis

**Contents**
- `superstore_sales.csv` 
- `queries_step_by_step.sql` 
- `superstore_analysis.py`
- 

4. The script will create summary CSVs and PNG charts in the same folder.

## SQL Queries (Short guide)
- Use `queries_step_by_step.sql` in a MySQL or compatible environment after loading `superstore_sales.csv` into a table named `superstore_sales`.
- Each query is numbered and includes a short purpose/explanation as comments.

## Notes
- Dataset is synthetic for learning and portfolio use.
- If you want a `.twb` Tableau workbook file, I can create dashboard images and provide steps to recreate the Tableau workbook manually.
